Pending:
    Generators:
        Take
        Delay
        Compose
        Sum
        Sine
        Square
        Triangle
        Repeat
        ASDREnvelope
        Mul (multiply two signals)
        Add
        Convolution
        Algorithmic Reverb (this will be a big project)
        Filters
        Normalize
    Make the oscilators infinite or finite length
    Measure the speed of the generators. Make a table showing execution time as a fraction of real time.
    Throw exception if length arguments are less than 0.
    Saw: handle start offset
    util.cpp, .hpp: p2f f2p a2l l2a
    make sure Generators handle zero length correctly and/or throw exception if created with zero length
    make sure memoization is never attempted on infinite generator (maybe IsFinite() method)
    delay allocation of buffer until first call to Generate()
    bug: when a MulConst is stack allocated, calling Play() causes seg fault

In Progress:

Done:
    Saw, finite or infinite
    play method for Generator, or maybe separate function
    MulConst
    capitalize Generate() and Play()
    AudioDef interface has GetGenerator method, Generator object can also implement AudioDef and just'
        return a clone of themselves for GetGenerator()
